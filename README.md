## üìñ Description

This project is a comprehensive AI Business Simulator designed to analyze e-commerce data and provide actionable business intelligence. It transforms raw, real-world transactional data into a multi-faceted, interactive dashboard built with Streamlit that helps businesses make strategic, data-driven decisions.

The application goes beyond simple historical analysis by leveraging a suite of advanced machine learning techniques to solve complex business problems. It serves as an all-in-one tool for a business manager to understand past performance, predict future outcomes, and model strategic decisions before implementing them.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This dashboard integrates several advanced AI modules to provide a holistic view of the business:

* **AI-Powered Sales Forecasting**: Utilizes Facebook's Prophet model for robust time series forecasting, predicting sales 90 days into the future.
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Breaks down the forecast into its core components (trend, weekly seasonality, yearly seasonality), making the model's predictions transparent and understandable.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Employs K-Means Clustering on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) data to automatically group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing habits.
* **Dynamic Pricing Simulator**: Features a prescriptive analytics model that simulates how changes in price might affect sales volume and total revenue, helping to optimize pricing strategies.
* **Real-Time External Data Integration**: Enhances the forecasting model's accuracy by incorporating real-world public search interest data from Google Trends as an external regressor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Core Language**: Python
* **Dashboard**: Streamlit
* **Data Manipulation**: pandas, numpy
* **Forecasting**: Prophet
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (for K-Means Clustering and Regression)
* **Visualization**: Plotly, matplotlib
* **API Integration**: Pytrends (for Google Trends)
